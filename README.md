# Fish-biomass-catches
The goal is to develop a comprehensive dataset for each Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that facilitates the validation and calibration of marine ecosystem models with a focus on fish and fisheries.

For each LME, the quarto files indicate which data is collated and how it is integrated to analyze fish community catch, landings, and biomass estimates from a variety of sources. This includes integrating fisheries catch statistics and scientific surveys.
